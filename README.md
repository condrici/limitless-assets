# Limitless API

Limitless API is one of the components of the Limitless Project that serves as an API Gateway.

It is based on Laravel and PHP 8 and it communicates with other microservices like Limitless Analytics. In the README of the installation repository "Limitless", you can find a diagram that shows how all components work together.
